title: "Who is Caro?"
description: |
  I am a curious and creative human, with a passion for data of all sorts. I love wrangling unconventional data, or using a visualization to build understanding and data literacy. 
  
  I have worked on a wide variety of client projects, from AI-generated graffiti and time series modeling to advanced analytics and data visualization. I thrive in environments where data, curiosity, creativity and rabbit holes are encouraged.
  
  In my spare time, you'll probably find me outside: either biking fast, wandering the neighborhood or playing spikeball.
