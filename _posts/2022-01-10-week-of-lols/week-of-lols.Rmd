One week, I decided to track every time I laughed. Turns out, perhaps unsurprisingly, if you know me in real life, I laugh a lot so this was a bit harder than I thought it would be.

Things I learned: 
* Appreciate the small things- if I hadn't written this stuff down, I probably wouldn't have remembered my roommate talking about vacuuming the ceiling as her excuse to get out of Zoom meetings. Life is about the little stuff just as much as the big. 

# TODO: pull stuff up from viz/data literacy deck! 

Cheers!
