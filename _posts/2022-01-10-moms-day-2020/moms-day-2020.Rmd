A couple weeks ago, I got a note from my mother. The card was gray, with floral designs on it; I recognized it immediately, because I'd made these cards for her; it was (and probably will be for a long itme to come) one of my favorite gifts I've ever given. 

You're probably wondering- what's so great about these cards??
